# FourierOccupancyShell

The Fourier Occupancy Shell algorithm measures the Global resolution anisotropy for cryo-EM maps, determining the quality of the map as well as infere if the particle distribution used to reconstruct the map is compatible with the resolution distributionvia directional FSC.

For a detail information about the algorithm see SETLINK TO MANUSCRIPT

# Installation

There are two independent ways of using/install this algorithm:

* Stand-alone installation
* Use it in Xmipp package inside Scipion, see instructions here to install Xmipp and Scipion
